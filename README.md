# Password-Generator
# Description
This repository contains my password generator website. This project was a homework assignment from the Case Western Reserve Univeristy's Coding Bootcamp. 
The password generator website was created using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code for a clean and polished user interface 
that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
